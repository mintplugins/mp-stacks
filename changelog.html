<p>

    <li>Localized JS String: "Click here to get more Content Types" for easy translation.</li>
    <li>Added link to AddOns on right side of Brick Editor</li>
    <li>Moved all grid-based js to it's own js file which is only enqueued by the add-on using it.</li>
    <li>Moved all grid-based php to their own files.</li>
    <li>Changed default space above/below Brick Content from 20px to 50px.</li>
    <li>One-Click "MP Buttons" installer added above Brick Text areas to make it easy for users who need this plugin.</li>
    <li>Security Fix: All "add_query_arg" function changed to "mp_core_add_query_arg" to properly sanitize the URLs</li>
    <li>Security Fix: All "remove_query_arg" function changed to "mp_core_remove_query_arg" to properly sanitize the URLs</li>

</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Added HTML note about inline JS</li>
    <li>Fixed Bug with some WordPress installations not firing the '99' function priority for 'save_post'. This was causing Bricks to not be placed into Stacks upon creation. Now the mp_stacks_order function that fires upon 'save_post' fires at priority 11 instead of 99.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.2.2 = April 3, 2015</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Added lightbox.js as dependancy for admin.js enqueue</li>
    <li>Added default height of 250px for "no brick" brick.</li>

</ul>
<strong>1.0.2.1 = March 30, 2015</strong>

</ul>
<strong>1.0.2.0 = March 26, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Brick ordering bug fix: Remove menu_order from all Brick WP Queries. This forces it to use meta_value_num and mp_stacks_oder{stack_id} so the order won't get changed when it shouldn't.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.1.9 = March 24, 2015</strong>
<ul>
    <li>TinyMCE Fix: Only re-initialize TinyMCE after Content-Type Reorders if it was previously set to be in “Visual” mode. Otherwise don’t reinitialize. This fixes the issue of having multiple text areas in one area upon re-ordering.</li>
    <li>Better styling for wp admin footer in minimal mode</li>
    <li>vertical-align grid items to "top" in front end css.</li>
    <li>Only show the "Edit this Stack's Bricks" if developer</li>

    <li>Right Side-Items in Brick Editor are now “closed” by default.</li>
    <li>Updated plugin checker to version in mp_core 1.0.1.2</li>
    <li>Changed priority of MP Stacks front end Enqueue to 1 so it's styles are output before other styles (was a lag on some machines where MP Stacks styles 'kicked-in' after load).</li>
    <li>Added bg inner div  which now holds the brick backgrounds</li>
    <li>Bricks-In-Stack list added to TinyMCE "Link" creator</li>
    <li>Brick Auto Scroll is now 100ms instead of 500ms</li>
    <li>Added CSS ID Selectors to Content Types and their container divs</li>
    <li>Added inline_js output in wp_footer</li>
    <li>Upon new Brick added to Stack, we loop through all Bricks in the Stack and order them starting at 1000 and going up by 10 each time. This fixes a bug where Stacks randomly had Bricks out of order.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.1.8 = March 1, 2015</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Added versions to all enqueues</li>
    <li>mp_core_post_submitted Jquery Trigger Added.</li>
    <li>Grid Background CSS Added</li>
    <li>Made it more difficult to accidentally insert existing stack by adding longer Warning message.</li>
    <li>Set default for leftright brick alignment using mp_core_get_post_meta</li>
    <li>Updated plugin checker to coincide with MP Core 1.0.1.1</li>
    <li>CSS Vertical Alignment change for first/second content type areas to “bottom” instead of “baseline”.</li>
    <li>Removed Mobile text size check. It’s too much of a hog for mobile devices.</li>

</ul>
<strong>1.0.1.6 = February 3, 2015</strong>
	<ul>
    	<li>Fixed bug with lightbox popups where they wouldn’t open because of the alternate URL.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.1.5 = February 1, 2015</strong>
	<ul>
    	<li>Fix for text areas when re-ordering contentTypes. TinyMce’s weren’t being re-set right when Content-Types were re-ordered.</li>
        <li>New option for Space Below: This allows the user to change the margin below the content-type area independently from the top (above) margin. Prevously, above and below had to match</li>
        <li>Moved Minimum height Meta option under the “Margin” showhider.</li>
        <li>Removed “Minimum” from space above/below option descriptions.</li>
        <li>Apply default of 20px below 1st content type on mobile sizes (<600px)</li>

        <li>Improved Button Styling inside text areas so they don’t bump into each other on mobile.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where, on some WP installs bricks weren’t getting added to Stacks because a priority was assigned to the save_post function - the priority was 100 - but 100 wasn’t firing at all on Brick saves. This fixes that.</li>
        <li>Better Masonry Handling for Grids</li>
        <li>Main Image Lightbox has moved from an Add-On to MP Stacks core.</li>
        <li>Made Image links css default to 100% width (only images without a link were doing this - although for most scenarios it isn’t an issue because of the max-width setting).</li>
        <li>For Lightboxes, added ability for alternate URL</li>
        <li>CSS Vertical Alignment change for img types to “baseline” instead of “text-bottom”.</li>

        <li>When duplicating a stack, you now have the option to preview the stack you are duplicating.</li>
        <li>Added some error checking when making a new stack via the stack template function.</li>
        <li>In grids, we remove the title attribute upon mouse over so we don’t have it covering the  grid item</li>
        <li>Removed “Edit” link from bottom of Stack Page Template.</li>
        <li>Made matched-height lightboxes animate to the correct size.</li>
        <li>New Filter hook called mp_stacks_brick_head_output which is used to output meta information based on a brick’s content.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed:  Other taxonomies' "edit" buttons weren't returned and so, were not linking to anything.</li>
    <li>First and Second Content Type divs set to inline-block so they wrap around content no matter what.</li>
