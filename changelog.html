<ul>
	<li>Upgraded Font Awesome to 4.4.0</li>

	<li>Moved all Theme Bundle installation functions to new file dedicated to those functions from misc-functions to theme-bundle-installation.php</li>
	<li>Attempt to set_time_limit for Stack Template creation functions. This is a backup in case some smaller servers have timeout limitations for PHP. Will only work if safe_mode is off.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.3.3 = September 28, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Bugfix: Widget CSS (and other non-shortcode added stacks) weren't properly getting their CSS output since 1.0.2.9 because of the scripts now being enqueued only-as-needed by the Content-Filters themselves. They are now re-output for any "leftover" stacks added to the page after the fact at priority 99 in wp_footer and shifted to the head.</li>
	<li>Security strengthen: Added intval() to mp_stack_id updates.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.3.2 = September 27, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The mp_brick function has arg change now including the Stack ID which is optionally passed to the function. Additional arguments are now stored in an $args array in the 4th argument position. The Stack ID is now set using the Stack ID arg passed to the function. If using ajax, no Stack ID variable is passed and it is ignored or uses the $saved_stack_id.</li>
	<li>When a brick is created using the MP Stacks templater, use new Stack Id for the mp_stack_id meta key.</li>
	<li>Make sure that $current_screen-&gt;post_type isset before using it.</li>
	<li>CSS fix for grid text holders (was outputting 2 semi-colons when only 1 was needed).</li>

	<li>Added function to get grid posts_per_row ratio value called mp_stacks_grid_posts_per_row_percentage.</li>
	<li>Hide the "Add New Brick" button in the Brick Editor as it isn't needed in this location.</li>
	<li>Changed brick slugs to "brick" - was previously 'stack'.</li>
	<li>Make mp-stacks-queried-object-id value for ajax return "false" if "Stack Only" page as there is no Queried Object Id (parent page).</li>
	<li>Hide all admin notices in brick editor as they aren't needed or helpful here.</li>
	<li>Make sure that the Admin Bar and Admin sidebar are always hidden in Brick Editor - even if not open in iframe.</li>
	<li>Use correct table prefixes for wpdb calls using $wpdb-&gt;base_prefix in mp-stack.php.</li>
	<li>Enqueue dashicons on Stack Only pages so the paintbrush icon will display on the "Edit This Brick" button.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.3.0 = September 22, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Added check for css_required before looping through it in the footer. Also moved function priority to 99 so it runs after Stacks that might have been after in the wp_footer.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.2.9 = September 21, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Remove the "View Bricks" option if the MP Stacks + Developer Plugin is not active</li>

	<li>Make isotope only filter items within the current brick using the Brick's ID selector in the JS output</li>
	<li>Fire Stack CSS output at wp_head above wp_enqueue_scripts. This way, if any subsequent action needs to be called using wp_enqueue_scripts, it can (ie Google Fonts).</li>
	<li>Stack/Brick CSS is no longer loaded as a separate document. All Stack/Brick CSS is now minimized and placed in the *head</li>
	<li>.</li>
	<li>CSS Style Tags now wrap around each Brick's CSS - so that CSS can be removed/replaced via ajax when Bricks are reloaded.</li>
	<li>The mp_brick function now gets the Stack ID from the Brick ID by using the mp_stack_order_STACKID meta field. Once the Brick gets its Stack ID, it saves it as postmeta under "mp_stack_id".</li>
	<li>When a new Brick is created, save the mp_stack_id there and then.</li>
	<li>Added action hook for new single stack page options called "mp_stacks_single_edit_page_options_table_bottom" which allows add-ons to output additional Single Stack options.</li>
	<li>Added action hook which fires when a Single Stack has been updated after the nonce has been verified to allow for the saving of additional options "mp_stacks_update_stack_options"</li>
	<li>Added filter hook for "/stack/" slug so people can change the slug to anything they wish. The filter is called "mp_stacks_stack_only_slug".</li>
	<li>Removed word-break:break-all for items in p tags. This was causing words to break to new lines when they shouldn't.</li>
	<li>MAJOR UPDATE: Brick Editor Loads Content Types via ajax now. All Add-On Metaboxes must be loaded through the "mp_brick_ajax_metabox" hook and will require MP Core 1.0.2.1 and MP Stacks 1.0.2.9</li>
	<li>MAJOR UPDATE: Instead of loading the whole page again when a Brick is updated, it now only re-loads that brick via ajax.</li>
	<li>Added "mp_stacks_centered_content_types" Filter Hook so add-ons can let MP Stacks know they work better as "Centered" and Brick's will auto set to be so.</li>
	<li>Lightbox padding change .mfp-iframe-scaler</li>
	<li>Brick Editor: Page contents are no longer hidden until it is all loaded.</li>
	<li>Brick Text Controls: Added Font/Text control for different device sizes: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile.</li>
	<li>Hide WooCommerce notices on Brick Editor as they are only needed in actual Dashboard.</li>

	<li>Added jQuery Namespaces to grid animations so they properly cancel the animations upon Ajax reload of a brick.</li>
	<li>Brick targets attr is now "mp_stacks_brick_target".</li>
	<li>Removed Action Hook: "mp_stacks_before_brick_css". Use the "mp_brick_css" Filter Hook and return required Brick CSS that way instead.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Added HTML note about inline JS</li>

	<li>Added lightbox.js as dependancy for admin.js enqueue</li>

</ul>
<strong>1.0.2.0 = March 26, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Brick ordering bug fix: Remove menu_order from all Brick WP Queries. This forces it to use meta_value_num and mp_stacks_oder{stack_id} so the order won't get changed when it shouldn't.</li>

<strong>1.0.1.9 = March 24, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>TinyMCE Fix: Only re-initialize TinyMCE after Content-Type Reorders if it was previously set to be in “Visual” mode. Otherwise don’t reinitialize. This fixes the issue of having multiple text areas in one area upon re-ordering.</li>

</ul>
<strong>1.0.1.5 = February 1, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for text areas when re-ordering contentTypes. TinyMce’s weren’t being re-set right when Content-Types were re-ordered.</li>
	<li>New option for Space Below: This allows the user to change the margin below the content-type area independently from the top (above) margin. Prevously, above and below had to match</li>
	<li>Moved Minimum height Meta option under the “Margin” showhider.</li>
	<li>Removed “Minimum” from space above/below option descriptions.</li>
	<li>Apply default of 20px below 1st content type on mobile sizes (&lt;600px)</li>

	<li>Fixed bug where, on some WP installs bricks weren’t getting added to Stacks because a priority was assigned to the save_post function - the priority was 100 - but 100 wasn’t firing at all on Brick saves. This fixes that.</li>
	<li>Better Masonry Handling for Grids</li>
	<li>Main Image Lightbox has moved from an Add-On to MP Stacks core.</li>
	<li>Made Image links css default to 100% width (only images without a link were doing this - although for most scenarios it isn’t an issue because of the max-width setting).</li>
	<li>For Lightboxes, added ability for alternate URL</li>
	<li>CSS Vertical Alignment change for img types to “baseline” instead of “text-bottom”.</li>

	<li>First and Second Content Type divs set to inline-block so they wrap around content no matter what.</li>
	<li>Changed: No longer removes left right custom margins on mobile. They remain no matter what now - where before they were reset to 0.</li>
